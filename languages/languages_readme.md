Translation steps:
Make sure all text not on gutenberg/editor and found in theme files are translatable.
(Use: __, _e, _x, esc_attr_e etc.)
Use WP-CLI to generate the .pot file that grabs all translatable strings seen above.
Then go into POedit or other PO editors and create a translation file (.po) and begin translating. :)
